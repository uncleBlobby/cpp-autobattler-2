Pickup radius for the gems -> should be 'hoovered up' by the player
    - animated juice for the pickup routine


Player HP bar
Player EXP bar (player currently doesn't even have EXP field)

Multiple attack types
    - different projectiles depending on attack mode?
    - attack 'mode' enum controls different functionality of shooting

    fix enemy spawning algorithm so that they appear from any side of screen

Other types of loot:
    'potion' items to heal health
    'boost' items to increase speed
    'invincibility' potion?
    'item types'?

Player stats
    - health increase with level
    - speed increase with level
    - armor stat?
    - luck stat?

Critical hit chance

Randomize damage rolls? (depending on weapon)?

Player "level up" -> choose upgrade

Upgrades:
    - increase health
    - increase damage
    - new weapon attacks
    - bigger pickup radius

Sound Effects

Basic Player Sprite / Enemy Sprite
    - think about the "shooting" animation, do we need a weapon / attack sprites?
